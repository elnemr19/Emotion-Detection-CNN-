# Emotion-Detection-CNN-

## 1. Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify facial expressions into one of seven categories: **Angry**, **Disgust**, **Fear**, **Happy**, **Sad**, **Surprise**, and **Neutral**. We will use ***convolutional neural networks (CNNs)*** to train our model, as they have been shown to be effective in image classification tasks. Our approach involves training a CNN model from scratch on the **FER-2013 dataset**.
